IBAN is an algorithm used by European banks to specify account numbers. The standard name IBAN (International Bank Account Number) provides a simple and fairly reliable method of validating the account numbers against simple typos that can occur during rewriting of the number, e.g., from paper documents, like invoices or bills, into computers.
An IBAN-compliant account number consists of:
•	a two-letter country code taken from the ISO 3166-1 standard (e.g., FR for France, GB for the United Kingdom, DE for Germany, and so on)
•	two check digits used to perform the validity checks – fast and simple, but not fully reliable, tests, showing whether a number is invalid (distorted by a typo) or seems to be good;
•	the actual account number (up to 30 alphanumeric characters – the length of that part depends on the country)



iban = input("Enter IBAN, please :")        # Input
iban = iban.replace('', '')                 # replace space
print("Replace-->", iban)

if not iban.isalnum():                              # Condition check
    print("You have enter invalid characters.")
elif len(iban) < 15:
    print("IBAN entered is too short")
elif len(iban) > 31:
    print("IBAN entered is too long")
else:
    iban = (iban[4:] + iban[0:4]).upper()       # convert to upper case
    print("___",iban)
    iban2 = ''
    for ch in iban:                             # loop
        if ch.isdigit():                        # check digit
            iban2 += ch
        else:
            iban2 += str(10 + ord(ch) - ord('A'))
            print("letter to number :",iban2)
    iban = int(iban2)
    print(iban)
    if iban % 97 == 1:
        print("IBAN is valid")
    else:
        print("IBAN is invalid")
